Solve more advanced problems on eigendecomposition and orthogonality than in the second course.
Use diagonalization of matrices for solving various problems from different branches of mathematics (ODE, dynamical systems).
Inner product spaces different from R^n: space of continuous functions, spaces of polynomials, spaces of matrices.
Work with geometric concepts as length (norm), distance, angles, and orthogonality in non-geometric setups.
Pythagorean Theorem, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and triangle inequality in various inner product spaces.
Orthogonal and orthonormal bases, and Gram-Schmidt process in various inner product spaces.
Min-max problems using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Best Approximation Theorem, least squares solutions.
Symmetric matrices and their properties; orthogonal diagonalization: how it is done and how to understand it geometrically.
Positive/negative definite matrices, indefinite matrices; various methods of determining definiteness of matrices.
Quadratic forms and their connection to symmetric matrices: uniqueness of this correspondence and its consequences.
Geometry of quadratic forms in two and three variables: conic sections and quadratic surfaces.
Some concepts from abstract algebra: group, ring, field, and isomorphism; understand the concept of isomorphic vector spaces.
